__Sohum Phadke__

ðŸ“š I'm currently pursuing a degree in **Bioengineering** at the **University of California, Berkeley**. Education is my primary focus right now, and I'm really passionate about Synthetic Biology and drug discovery.

ðŸŒŸ When I'm not buried in textbooks and lectures, you can often find me **playing tennis and/or listening to music**. I believe in maintaining a balanced life, and these hobbies keep me inspired and refreshed.

__Here are some of my graduation pics!__
